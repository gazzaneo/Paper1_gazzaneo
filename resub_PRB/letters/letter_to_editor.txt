Dear Dr. Kancharla,

Thank you very much for your e-mail from October 24th with the reply of the Referees on our paper. The first Referee recommends publication without hesitation. The second Referee believes that the paper has to be published in Physical Review B, discussing the points he raised.

In the new version of our paper we have taken into account in detail all comments. A detailed reply is also included to this letter.

We hope that our paper is now suitable for publication in Phys. Rev. B.

Yours sincerely,
Paolo Gazzaneo, Tommaso Maria Mazzocchi, Jan Lotze and Enrico Arrigoni
