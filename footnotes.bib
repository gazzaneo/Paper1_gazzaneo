abstract = {The selective extraction of hot electrons to suitable energy contacts is a key aspect towards the development of hot carrier solar cells. Here we employ Time Resolved THz Spectroscopy (TRTS) to evaluate the extent to which hot electron transfer (HET) takes place from the 1Pe states of colloidal 3nm PbSe quantum dots molecularly linked by 3-mercaptopropionic acid to mesoporous SnO2 and TiO2 sensitized films. For PbSe–3MPA–SnO2 samples, we show that the efficiency of hot electron transfer is negligibly small at room temperature, i.e. within the ∼10% detection limit of our measurements. The impact of spurious signals on TRTS data arising from carrier dynamics regarding QDs aggregates – which can be misinterpreted as HET – is discussed in detail. In contrast, in line with previous reports, hot electron transfer is observed to take place from the Pe states of colloidal PbSe QDs in the PbSe–3MPA–TiO2 system, with an efficiency ⩾80%. These results are rationalized in terms of a stronger donor–acceptor coupling between QD and oxide for the TiO2 electrode when compared with a SnO2 electrode, a factor that ultimately defines the kinetic competition between electron transfer rate towards the oxide and intraband cooling within the QDs.}

@article{ti.ke.10,
title = "Hot-electron transfer from semiconductor nanocrystals",
abstract = "In typical semiconductor solar cells, photons with energies above the semiconductor bandgap generate hot charge carriers that quickly cool before all of their energy can be captured, a process that limits device efficiency. Although fabricating the semiconductor in a nanocrystalline morphology can slow this cooling, the transfer of hot carriers to electron and hole acceptors has not yet been thoroughly demonstrated. We used time-resolved optical second harmonic generation to observe hot-electron transfer from colloidal lead selenide (PbSe) nanocrystals to a titanium dioxide (TiO2) electron acceptor. With appropriate chemical treatment of the nanocrystal surface, this transfer occurred much faster than expected. Moreover, the electric field resulting from sub-50-femtosecond charge separation across the PbSe-TiO2 interface excited coherent vibrations of the TiO2 surface atoms, whose motions could be followed in real time.
